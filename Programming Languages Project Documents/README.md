# Compiling and Running the Project Code

## Project Code:
- [CPSC354_FA22_Project.ipynb](https://github.com/MNGSunday/CPSC354_FA22_Domingo/blob/main/Programming%20Languages%20Project%20Documents/CPSC354_FA22_Project.ipynb)
- [CPSC354_FA22_Project.pdf](https://github.com/MNGSunday/CPSC354_FA22_Domingo/blob/main/Programming%20Languages%20Project%20Documents/CPSC354_FA22_Project.pdf
)

  - This is the output of the Jupyter Notebook python code as a PDF. 
## How to Compile:
- Download *CPSC354_FA22_Domingo.ipynb* and open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) *(recommended as it is where I had initially compiled everything)*, or another compiler capable of running Jupyter Notebooks.
- Connect the Notebook to the online compiler by pressing the "run" button to the left of the very first block of code within the notebook.
- Proceed in compiling and running each subsequent code block by pressing the "run" button next to each code block
		
	- A code block has successfully finished running once a green check mark appears to the left of the "run" button. It is important that each code block is ran in order as most code blocks rely on the changes made in a previous code block.
	- Do not run the very last code block as it was written specifically to output the format of the entire notebook (including the printed outputs and graphs) as a PDF.
